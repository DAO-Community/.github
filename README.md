# .github

**📄 File under 🏗 construction.**

## Introduction
Default files for [@TheAlgorithms](https://github.com/DAO-Community) repositories.

GitHub will use and display default files for any public repository in [@TheAlgorithms](https://github.com/DAO-Community) organization that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- the root of the repository
- the `.github` folder
- the `docs` folder

For example, anyone who creates an issue or pull request in a public repository that does not have its own CONTRIBUTING file will see a link to the default CONTRIBUTING file.

The files are not included in `clones`, `packages`, or `downloads` of individual repositories because they are stored only in the `.github` repository.

## Supported file types
The default file types supported by GitHub are as follows:

- [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project): A CODE_OF_CONDUCT file defines standards for how to engage in a community.
- [`CONTRIBUTING`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors): A CONTRIBUTING file communicates how people should contribute to your project.
- [`FUNDING`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository): A FUNDING file displays a sponsor button in your repository to increase the visibility of funding options for your open source project. 
- [`Issue and pull request templates`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates): Issue and pull request templates customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to include when they open issues and pull requests in your repository. 
- [`SECURITY`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository): 	A SECURITY file gives instructions for how to responsibly report a security vulnerability in your project.
- [`SUPPORT`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-support-resources-to-your-project): A SUPPORT file lets people know about ways to get help with your project.

Note: License files must be added to individual repositories so the file will be included when a project is cloned, packaged, or downloaded.

| https://github.com/DAO-Community/.github/labels/type%3A%20bug%20%F0%9F%90%9B | State: Reincarnated | | 000000 | Something is reincarnated. |

### Active
For issues, must be in open status.
For projects, must have contributions for the last 3 months.

### Inactive
An inactive project is one that hasn’t had any operations/contributions for atleast 3 months, depending on how the project is classified for risk under Directive 013: Suspension Requirements for Projects.

### Suspended
Once inactive, projects outlined in Directive 013 must be suspended to ensure community safety and organizational protection. Projects can remain suspended until the Steering Committee determines that the project is no longer needed for any development/operations and can be abandoned.

### Abandoned (Archived)
When a project no longer needs development, it must be permanently sealed and taken out of service. This process is known as abandonment. Directive 020: Well Abandonment details strict rules that ensure that the well is in a safe and secure state.

### Reincarnated
Abandoned projects may be referenced or rebuilt as a new project. Reincarnated projects must reference the Abandoned project and must follow its license.
This state is short-lived and must be used only for initial setup of the project. Once active development has begun, state must be moved to Active.

## State Flow (WIP)

Active >> Inactive
Inactive >> (Active, Suspended)
Suspended >> (Active, Abandoned)
Abandoned >> Reincarnated
Reincarnated >> Active

### Maintained
Maintained projects/issues can be in any state: active, inactive, or suspended. A Project Maintainer is taking responsiblity of the project.

### Orphaned
Orphaned projects/issues can be in any state: active, inactive, suspended, or abandoned. No Project Maintainer or Working Group is taking responsiblity of the project. Once a project is designated/labeled as orphan, the DAO Community Steering Committee provides care and custody of the project until the project has been abandoned.
