# BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) [@bdfl](https://github.com/orgs/DAO-Community/teams/bdfl)

- (For Nomination by the Steering Committee or appointed by the Corporate Maintainer)

This organization follows a BDFL Governance Structure.

> Under this structure, one person (usually the initial author of the project) has final say on all major project decisions. [Python](https://github.com/python) is a classic example. Smaller projects are probably BDFL by default, because there are only one or two maintainers. A project that originated at a company might also fall into the BDFL category.
